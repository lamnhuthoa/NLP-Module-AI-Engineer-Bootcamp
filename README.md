# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Module

This repository contains work completed during my AI Engineer Bootcamp, focusing on essential concepts and practical implementations in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

## 📚 What I Learned

Throughout this module, I explored and implemented the following key topics:

- 🔤 **Text Preprocessing**  
  Techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to prepare raw text for analysis.

- 🏷️ **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging & Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
  Identifying grammatical roles and extracting named entities from text using NLP libraries.

- 😊 **Sentiment Analysis**  
  Classifying the emotional tone of text data using pre-built and custom models.

- 🧮 **Text Vectorization**  
  Transforming text into numerical representations using methods like Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and word embeddings.

- 🧵 **Topic Modeling**  
  Discovering abstract topics in large text corpora using models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

- 🛠️ **Custom Text Classification**  
  Building and evaluating a custom text classifier using machine learning techniques.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- NLTK
- spaCy
- scikit-learn
- gensim
- pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📌 Notes
This module showcases my understanding and hands-on skills in NLP, built through project-based learning in a real AI Engineer Bootcamp.
